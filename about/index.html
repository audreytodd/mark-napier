            <p>Mark Napier, born in 1961 in Springfield, NJ is a painter turned digital artist. Originally Napier was trained in painting and worked as a self taught programmer in the New York financial market until 1995 when he was introduced to the web. He uses his background in coding to create expressive netart pieces that utilize worldwide networks as a public domain. One of his first main projects was the Distorted Barbie, a series of photoshopped Barbies that riffed off of Barbie as a capitalist symbol. This pushed him down an artistic path of creating netart that served as counterculture such as The Shredder and Riot!.</p>

            <p>He eventually created his own domain, potatoland.org, where his digital pieces are housed. There is a heavy focus on user interaction throughout his pieces as a lot of them are websites, but there is also a large amount of digital portraits/paintings that are featured in museums throughout the world. Napier continues to live and work in New York City to this day.

        <p>Net.flag is an online site that allows for territorial exploration of the internet. It is a piece that is made to not just be viewed but to change. There is a user interface provided where the visitor to net.flag can change the appearance of the flag based on their territory, identity, political standing, or anything else. From Napier’s website, “The resulting flag is both an emblem and a micro territory in its own right; a place for confrontation, assertion, communication and play. The Internet is not a geographic location. It is a space created by man-made infrastructure that carries the potential of information, group identity, economic and political advantage. Nations and terrorists alike use the Internet to carry out their agendas. Those who control the structures, both hard and soft, that make this new space, control the nature of the space itself, providing or limiting access to the resources of the network.” The piece was commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum and then acquired into their permanent collection. It was also exhibited in Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria, September 2002,  and in The print “One Year of Flags” exhibited at the group show “World on a Wire” at bitforms gallery, New York, 2012., also “net.flag highlights”, video slideshow of 800 flags shows at the Big Screen Plaza, Eventi Hotel, New York City, 2011., and finally the NYT article “Getting Tangible Dollars for an Intangible Creation” written by Matthew Mirapaul </p>

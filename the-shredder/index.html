      <p>On Napier’s website this piece is defined as “an alternative web browser that turns web pages into digital confetti”. The Shredder reveals the nature behind the web as the user types in the web address and then markup, text, images, code, and links are scattered throughout the screen. The raw materials of the web are shredded then revealed and thrown about with no order at all. The piece was featured on the cover of “New Media Art” by Mark Tribe and Reena Jana, Taschen, 2006 and featured in a NYT article from 1998 entitled “When Artists Build Their Own Browsers”</p>
